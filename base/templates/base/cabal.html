    <h2>Cabal</h2>
    <p>
        The Cabal is a collection of Assassins who take on the duties of running the Guild. There are multiple different roles and responsibilities within the Cabal, which are described in their own sections. Overarchingly, Cabal members work together to maintain and operate the Guild, both day-to-day as well as through organisation of events and games. Every Cabal member will umpire a game during their year-long term, bringing their own unique ideas and flair to always make for a great week!
